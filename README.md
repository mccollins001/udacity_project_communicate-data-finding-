## Dataset

> The US Adult income dataset is a repository of 48,842 entries extracted from the 1994 US Census database. 
It contains 15 columns before cleaning.

## Summary of Findings

> During my exploratory analysis, I focused on how different factors like `age`, `education`, `sex` etc. affected the salary of people in the dataset. I found out that you are more likely to earn above 50k if you :
- are a man
- are married
- have atleast a bachelors degree
- are a white person (don't think it has to do with racism)
- are between the ages of 30 and 60 with 40 being the best age
- are working long hours

I investigated further and surprisingly discovered that there is no correlation between education qualification and how long people work. Rather workhour has a positive corelation with salary. 




## Key Insights for Presentation

> In my presentation, I focused on salary and four factors that affect salary and found out how they affect it. These 4 factors are: age, sex, education, relationship, work hour (hour-per-week). I made sure I used the correct plot for  every investigation.
